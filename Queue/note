                                                                 Queue
                                                             =============
---> Queue is a linear Datasture                                                 class Queue:-
---> Element are Inserted from one side and removed from                                inport queue
     another side                                                                       queue = queue.QUEUE()
---> Queue Will be open at both ends                                                    queue.put(element)
---> The end where elements inserted is called Back/Rear/Tail                           queue.get()
---> The end where the elements are removed are called Front/Head                   note:- 
---> Queue follows FIFO or LILO                                                          if there is no space to add element or 
eg: printing multiple documents                                                          there is no elements to remove it will wait
---> There are mainly two operations in QUEUE                                            untill requerments satisfy.we can set a 
            i) Enqueue:-                                                                 timeout to stop the wail 
                    The process of adding elements to the queue                          eg:queue.put(element,timeout=1)
            ii) Dequeue:-
                    The process of removing elements from queue
            --------------------------------------------------------
            Other than that we have,
            i)  isFull
            ii) isEmpty
            iii) Not Queue
---> we can impliment Queue using List and Class Modules
        List:-
            i) Oueue.append(element)
               Queue.pop(0)

            ii) Queue.insert(0,element)
                Queue.pop()
        Class modules:-
                class collection:-
                        i)import collections
                          queue = collections.deque()
                        here we have 2 options to add and remove
                             i)queue.append(element)
                               queue.popleft()
                             ii)queue.appendleft(element)
                                queue.pop()
