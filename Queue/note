              Queue
         =============
---> Queue is a linear Datasture 
---> Element are Inserted from one side and removed from
     another side
---> Queue Will be open at both ends
---> The end where elements inserted is called Back/Rear/Tail
---> The end where the elements are removed are called Front/Head
---> Queue follows FIFO or LILO
eg: printing multiple documents
---> There are mainly two operations in QUEUE
            i) Enqueue:-
                    The process of adding elements to the queue
            ii) Dequeue:-
                    The process of removing elements from queue
            --------------------------------------------------------
            Other than that we have,
            i)  isFull
            ii) isEmpty
            iii) Not Queue
---> we can impliment Queue using List and Class Modules
        List:-
            i) Oueue.append(element)
               Queue.pop(0)

            ii) Queue.insert(0,element)
                Queue.pop()
        Class modules:-
